# Emotion Detector

## Introduction
Welcome to the Emotion Detector Model GitHub repository! This project focuses on developing a deep learning model to detect emotions from images. The model utilizes convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and incorporates various techniques, including data augmentation, to enhance its performance.

## Project Overview
Emotion detection from images is a crucial task with numerous applications, ranging from user experience enhancement in applications to understanding emotional responses in marketing. This project aims to build a robust deep learning model capable of accurately detecting emotions from images.

## Features
- **Emotion Detection**: The model is trained to recognize emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger, surprise, fear, disgust, and neutral expressions.
- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**: CNNs are used to automatically learn and extract relevant features from images, making them ideal for image-based tasks like emotion detection.
- **Data Augmentation**: Techniques such as rotation, flipping, zooming, and shifting are applied to increase the diversity of the training data, thus improving the model's generalization and performance.
- **Python Implementation**: The entire project is implemented in Python using popular deep learning libraries such as TensorFlow and Keras.

## Dataset
The model is trained on a dataset of facial expressions. You can use public datasets like the FER2013 dataset or CK+ dataset, or collect your own dataset.

## Training
Train the model using the provided scripts or notebooks. Experiment with different architectures, hyperparameters, and data augmentation techniques to improve performance.

## Evaluation
Evaluate the model's performance using evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. This helps in understanding the model's strengths and weaknesses.
